# Advanced Negation Demo
# Shows double negation, contraposition, and complex negated formulas

propositions:
  - AllowAccess
  - DenyAccess
  - RequireAuth
  - GrantFullPermissions

steps:
  # Step 1: Apply double negation elimination (~~DatabaseConnected -> DatabaseConnected)
  - rule: doubleNegation
    subtype: elimination
    from:
      - ~~DatabaseConnected
      
  # Step 2: Create implication (UserIsAdmin -> AllowAccess)  
  - rule: alpha
    subtype: implies
    from:
      - UserIsAdmin
      - AllowAccess
      
  # Step 3: Apply contraposition to get (~AllowAccess -> ~UserIsAdmin)
  - rule: contraposition
    from:
      - (UserIsAdmin → AllowAccess)
      
  # Step 4: Combine admin status with security
  - rule: alpha
    subtype: and
    from:
      - UserIsAdmin
      - SystemSecure
      
  # Step 5: Admin + Security implies full permissions
  - rule: alpha
    subtype: implies
    from:
      - (UserIsAdmin ∧ SystemSecure)
      - GrantFullPermissions

targets:
  - DatabaseConnected                    # From double negation elimination
  - AllowAccess                         # From admin status
  - GrantFullPermissions                # From admin + security
  - (~AllowAccess → ~UserIsAdmin)       # From contraposition
  - (UserIsAdmin ∧ SystemSecure)        # Conjunction
